  "I am a recent graduate from SFSU in Computer Science looking for full time and entry level positions. I aspire to be the best software engineer I can be. I try to be consistent in who I am and whatever I set my mind on. I am always up for self and peer improvement no matter the scale.  Anything significant wasn't built in a day, so my philosophy is to be as dependable as possible to build and improve one small step at a time.";
